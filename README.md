## How to Use

1. Choose "Take a Photo" or "Select from Gallery" from the main screen.
2. If you choose "Take a Photo," the camera app will open, allowing you to capture the image you want to recognize.
   If you choose "Select from Gallery," you can pick an image from your phone's gallery.
3. Once the image is selected, the application will automatically recognize numbers and units within the image.
4. You can perform unit conversions between the recognized numbers and units.

## Notes

- Ensure the image has good quality for accurate recognition of numbers and units.
- The application currently supports units such as (examples): `meters`, `feet`, `milliliters`, `gallons`, `centimeters`, `inches`, etc.
- For more detailed information, please refer to the code documentation.
